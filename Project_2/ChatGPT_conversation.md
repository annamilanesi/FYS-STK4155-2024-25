# ChatGPT Conversation

## User & ChatGPT Interaction

- **User:** Explain why the test has a lower mean squared error (MSE) than the training set.
- **ChatGPT:** Discusses overfitting and underfitting as possible reasons for this phenomenon, along with suggestions for improving model generalization.

- **User:** Add a validation loss check every 10 epochs in the `train_layers_SGD` function.
- **ChatGPT:** Modifies the function to include a validation loss calculation and print statement.

- **User:** Create a function called `mse_n_nodes()` to plot MSE as the number of nodes in hidden layers varies.
- **ChatGPT:** Provides a function definition and implementation for `mse_n_nodes()`.

- **User:** Ensure that the output size can be passed as a parameter to make the function usable for classification problems.
- **ChatGPT:** Updates the `mse_n_nodes()` function to accept the output size parameter.

- **User:** Write a piece of code that uses the `mse_n_nodes()` function.
- **ChatGPT:** Provides a code snippet demonstrating how to call the `mse_n_nodes()` function with necessary parameters.

- **User:** Add activation functions and their derivatives as parameters to the `mse_n_nodes()` function.
- **ChatGPT:** Updates the function signature to include activation functions and their derivatives.

- **User:** Update the call to `mse_n_nodes()` to include the new activation function variables.
- **ChatGPT:** Provides the revised function call with activation function parameters included.

- **User:** Write a function called `mse_n_hidden_layers()` similar to `mse_n_nodes()`, but it should vary the number of hidden layers while keeping the number of nodes fixed.
- **ChatGPT:** Defines and implements the `mse_n_hidden_layers()` function that plots MSE against the number of hidden layers.

- **User:** Add cost function and cost derivative as parameters to the new `mse_n_hidden_layers()` function.
- **ChatGPT:** Updates the function to accept cost function and cost derivative as parameters.

- **User:** Define the Leaky ReLU and ELU activation functions and their derivatives.
- **ChatGPT:** Provides the definitions for Leaky ReLU and ELU, along with their derivatives.

- **User:** How to include a ChatGPT conversation on GitHub.
- **ChatGPT:** Provides a step-by-step guide for copying and formatting the conversation into a Markdown file for GitHub.

- **User:** I want to copy all this conversation and put it on GitHub, but I want it all in English (no Italian).
- **ChatGPT:** Instructs the user on how to translate and format the conversation into English for GitHub.

- **User:** Do it for me, copy all this conversation and put it in a Markdown file all in English.
- **ChatGPT:** Provides the entire conversation formatted as a Markdown file.
